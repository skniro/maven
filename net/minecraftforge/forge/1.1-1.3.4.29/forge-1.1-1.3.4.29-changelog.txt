		As well as the concept of damage absorption vs reduction.

Build 1.3.2.4
	LexManos
		Created a Entity tracking ans spawning system.
		Mod creators should call MinecraftForge.registerEntity to register a entity.
		All entity ID numbers are Mod Unique. Meaning two mods can have Entity #1.
		Added client and server side packet handlers for the 'Forge' channel. For use in internal packets such as the new Spawn packet.
		Updated the build scripts to copy over unique server source files now that there actually are some.
		For modders:
		  If you have a entity that used MLMP's 'owner' system, you should have your entity implement IThrowableEntity
		  If you have a entity that implments MLMLP's ISpawnable, you should implement ISpawnHandler.
		They provide the same functionality, just in a cleaner, more orginized way and will be the method used when we eventually drop MLMP.
